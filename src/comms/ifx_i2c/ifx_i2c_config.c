/** @brief This is IFX I2C context. Only one context is supported per slave.
 *
 * - The following parameters in #ifx_i2c_context_t must be initialized with appropriate values <br>
 *   - <b>slave address</b> : Address of I2C slave
 *   - <b>frame_size</b> : Frame size in bytes. Minimum supported value is 16 bytes.<br> 
 *              - It is recommended not to use a value greater than the slave's frame size.
 *              - The user specified frame size is written to I2C slave's frame size register.
 *                The frame size register is read back from I2C slave.
 *                This frame value is used by the ifx-i2c protocol even if it is not equal to the user specified value.
 *
 *   - <b>frequency</b> : Frequency/speed of I2C master in KHz.
 *              - This must be lowest of the maximum frequency supported by the devices (master/slave) connected on the 
 *                bus.
 *              - Initial negotiation starts with a frequency of 100KHz.
 *              - If the user specified frequency is more than 400 KHz, the I2C slave is configured to operate in 
 *                "Fm+" mode, otherwise the I2C slave is configured for "SM & Fm" mode. <br>
 *              - If the user specified frequency negotiation fails, the I2C master frequency remains at 
 *                100KHz<br>
 * 
 *   - <b>upper_layer_event_handler</b> : Upper layer event handler. This is invoked when #ifx_i2c_open() is 
 *                                        asynchronously completed.
 *   - <b>upper_layer_ctx</b> : Context of upper layer.
 *   - <b>p_slave_vdd_pin</b> : GPIO pin for VDD. If not set, cold reset is not done. 
 *   - <b>p_slave_reset_pin</b> : GPIO pin for Reset. If not set, warm reset is not done.
 *   - <b>ifx_i2c_datastore_config</b> : Data store configuration instance
 * - The other fields must be initialized by the user of the structure.
